# Network Access Guide - Sentiment Analysis App

## üåê Making Your App Accessible from Other Devices

This guide explains how to access your Sentiment Analysis application from other devices on the same network (phones, tablets, other computers).

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Admin Setup (One-time setup)
1. **Right-click** on `setup_and_run_admin.bat`
2. Select **"Run as Administrator"**
3. Follow the prompts - this configures your firewall

### Step 2: Get Your Network Address
After running the admin setup, you'll see something like:
```
Network access: http://172.20.171.84:5000
```
**This is your network address!**

### Step 3: Connect from Other Devices
- **Phone/Tablet**: Connect to same WiFi, open browser, go to `http://172.20.171.84:5000`
- **Other Computers**: Ensure same network, open browser, go to `http://172.20.171.84:5000`

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't connect" or "Site can't be reached"

**Solution 1: Check Network Connection**
- Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check your computer's IP address: `ipconfig`
- Verify the IP hasn't changed (WiFi networks sometimes reassign IPs)

**Solution 2: Firewall Issues**
```bash
# Run as Administrator:
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Sentiment Analysis App"
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Sentiment Analysis App" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
```

**Solution 3: Antivirus/Security Software**
- Temporarily disable antivirus
- Add Python.exe and your project folder to antivirus exceptions
- Some security software blocks network connections

**Solution 4: Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Check what's using port 5000:
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```

### Problem: IP Address Changes

Your IP address might change when you:
- Restart your computer
- Disconnect/reconnect to WiFi  
- Connect to a different network

**Solution:** Re-run `setup_and_run_admin.bat` to get the new IP address

### Problem: App Loads But Features Don't Work

This usually means:
- **File uploads fail**: Check upload folder permissions
- **Analysis doesn't work**: Dependencies missing, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Slow performance**: Large files + weak network connection

## üèó Network Architecture

```
Your Computer (172.20.171.84:5000)
    ‚Üì
WiFi Router/Network (172.20.168.1)
    ‚Üì
Other Devices:
    üì± Phone (172.20.171.85)
    üíª Laptop (172.20.171.86)
    üì∫ Smart TV (172.20.171.87)
```

All devices need to be on the **same network segment** (same WiFi/LAN).

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Security Level: **Development/Local Network**
- ‚úÖ Safe for same WiFi network (home, office)
- ‚úÖ Safe for trusted devices
- ‚ùå **NOT** safe for public internet exposure

### For Production Use:
- Add user authentication
- Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add input validation/sanitization

---

## ‚öô Configuration Files

### Flask Configuration (`config.py`):
```python
# Already configured for network access:
host='0.0.0.0'  # Accepts connections from any IP
port=5000       # Standard Flask port
```

### Firewall Rule:
```bash
Rule Name: "Sentiment Analysis App"
Direction: Inbound
Action: Allow  
Protocol: TCP
Local Port: 5000
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### API Access from Other Devices:
```bash
# From another computer/device on the network:
curl -X POST http://172.20.171.84:5000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"comments": ["Great app!", "Needs improvement"]}'
```

### File Upload from Mobile:
1. Open browser on mobile: `http://172.20.171.84:5000`
2. Click "Choose File" 
3. Select CSV/Excel file from phone storage
4. Upload and analyze normally

## üÜò Quick Help Commands

### Get Current IP Address:
```bash
ipconfig | findstr "IPv4 Address"
```

### Check If Port 5000 is Open:
```bash
netstat -an | findstr :5000
```

### Test Connection from Another Device:
```bash
# Replace IP with your actual IP:
